# Showoff Test

### Initial consideration: The Instagram API is currently deprecated, so obtaining user data and images is not possible by this means. In this case I followed the Instagram access guide through the Facebook API ([new Instagram Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/products/instagram/))

## Login
In the login you must enter the credentials of Facebook.\
**IMPORTANT**: The account you login must be linked to instagram.\

## Home
In **Home** you will find all the user's recent posts. You can scrolldown to review them.
It shows the *place*, the *image* and the *message* associated with this image.\
You can logout by clicking on the upper right button, it will take you back to the Login screen. \
If the user already has his session open, when opening the application he will find the Home screen directly. \
